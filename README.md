  # Fitness Tracker
  This fitness app allows you to view, create and track daily workouts. You can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. You can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, you can track your distance traveled.
